C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

Pointers bring the C language closer to the machine.
Therefore, the C language is speed critical, ie efficiency critical.
When we create an object in C language, the compiler actually specifies an address belonging to that object.
There are many ways to display the address on the screen in the C language.
In this program, the address of an object named x with the adressof (&) operator is given as the initial value to an object named ptr. 
Then the address of object x is displayed on the screen.

Good work and Best Regards.
