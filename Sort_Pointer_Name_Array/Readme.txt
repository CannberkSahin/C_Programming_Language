C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

In this program, it is shown that the names in the pointer array are sorted 
alphabetically with the bubble sort algorithm. A pointer array with 300 names is defined. 
There are string literals in the array. Since the first element of these string literals 
is converted to an address with array decay, the array is actually an array that holds the 
addresses. This is called pointer array. The array is defined as const char * p. This means 
that the string literals of the elements in the array are not changed. However, the location 
of the array elements can be changed. Therefore, it can be used with array sorting algorithms.
Bubble sort algorithm is used to sort the elements of the array. The strcmp function in the 
string.h library is used to compare the lengths of the two posts. Finally, the series listed 
from a to z alphabetically is printed on the screen.


Good work and Best Regards.
