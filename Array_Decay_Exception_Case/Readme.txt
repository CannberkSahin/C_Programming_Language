C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

When the name of an array is used in an expression in the C language (with one exception)
it is always converted to the address of the first element of the array. This exception is 
the sizeof operator.If the sizeof operator is the operator, the string name is not converted to an address.
Note that when an array is the operator of the sizeof operator, array decay is not applied.

Good work and Best Regards.
