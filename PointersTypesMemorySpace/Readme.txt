C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

Objects occupy a certain amount of memory in C language. 
This situation can vary from compiler to compiler.
GCC compiler is used in this program.
In this compiler, the char type takes 1 byte, the int type 4 bytes and the long int type takes 8 bytes.
However, the addresses of objects always occupy the same size in compilers.
Object addresses take up 4 bytes in the GCC compiler.
This situation may change in another compiler.
In the program, the space occupied by the objects and object addresses in the memory is printed on the screen.

Good work and Best Regards.
