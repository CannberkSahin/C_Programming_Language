C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

Commas are used in two different ways in the C language.The first method is called a comma separated list.
For example, if we are initializing more than one object, this method is used.
int a,b,c; //Here is an example of the list separated by commas.
Another method is to use the comma as an operator.
In this program, the code for the comma idiom, which is a very common idiom in the C language, was written.
When the comma operator is used, it is guaranteed by the language to make the statement left first.
However, the comma operator produces the value of the right-hand expression.

Good work and Best Regards.
