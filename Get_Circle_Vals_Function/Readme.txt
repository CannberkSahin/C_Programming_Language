C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

Mathematical operations are used frequently in the C language.
It is especially important to find the areas and contours of geometric shapes.
In some cases, for example, it may be necessary to find both the area and the 
circumference of a circle at the same time. If it is desired to write a function 
for this, a function in C language has at most one return statement.
The only way to do this is to use pointer semantics.
The function has 3 parameters. The first parameter asks for the radius.
The second and third parameter requests an address for the area and perimeter.
Thus, the calculated area and perimeter are written to their own addresses
and the values are transmitted without a retrun expression.
As a result, two values can be calculated at the same time and sent by the function.

Good work and Best Regards.
