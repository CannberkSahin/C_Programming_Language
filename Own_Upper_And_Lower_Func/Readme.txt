C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

The C language is case sensitive.
There are functions in the Ctype.h library that detect whether they are capital or lowercase letters.
However, we can write these functions ourselves.
In this program, islower, isupper, toupper and tolower functions in ctype.h library were written ourselves.

Good work and Best Regards.
