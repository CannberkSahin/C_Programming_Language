C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

The sum of the two address values in the C language is again an address value. 
In this case, there is a syntax error. However, the value obtained by subtracting 
the two address values from each other is an integer value. 
This value is independent of the type of variables. You can take advantage of this situation. 
For example, we have an array named a. The value of (a + 5) - (a + 2) is 3.
An example of the situation described above is shown in this program.

Good work and Best Regards.
