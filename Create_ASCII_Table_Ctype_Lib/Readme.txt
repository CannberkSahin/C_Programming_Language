C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

An ASCII table was created using ctype.h, a standard C library. 
While making the table, the ready functions in the ctype.h file are used.
These functions are functions like isupper islower. 
The program has only the main function.
When the program is run, the basic ASCII table appears on the screen.

Good work and Best Regards.
