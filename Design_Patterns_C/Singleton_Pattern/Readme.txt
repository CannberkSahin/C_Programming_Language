C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

n software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a 
commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished 
design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template 
for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.Design 
patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. 
Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later 
in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause 
major problems and improves code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns.
In this program, a simple singleton design pattern has been implemented.

Good work and Best Regards.
