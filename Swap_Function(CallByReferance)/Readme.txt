C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

The replacement of two numbers function is used quite often in the C language.
However, there is no standard replacement function in the C language. 
So we have to write this function ourselves.
The exchange of two integers or float numbers in C is called a swap.
That's why the function is named as swap.
The program replaces two integer numbers. 
If you want to swap float numbers, you can change the int in the function to float.

Good work and Best Regards.
