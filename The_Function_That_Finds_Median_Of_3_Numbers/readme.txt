C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

An algorithm has been developed to find the median of 3 integers.
It is easy to find the biggest and smallest of the 3 numbers, but finding the middle number is not easy.
So first of all 3 numbers are found the biggest and the smallest, the median number is neither the biggest nor the smallest.
In short, we get 3 numbers. These are a, b and c. If the number a is the largest or the smallest, it is not a median.
In this case, we can find out whether a is a median by taking the not of a.
We have this situation checked for other numbers.

Good work and Best Regards.
