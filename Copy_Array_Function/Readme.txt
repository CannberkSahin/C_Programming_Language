C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

Arrays cannot be assigned to each other in the C language.The reason for this is array decay.
An array name is converted to an address. The definition that turns into an address is R value expression.
Therefore, L value expressions cannot be assigned to the right side expression.
If you want to copy an array to another array, the way to do that is to write a function.
A function named cop_array is written in this program. The function has been written in two different ways. 
One of the methods is the classic and the other is the idiom. 
First, a series of random numbers named a was created.
Then this sequence has been copied to the b array with the copy function. 
The numbers in the two series are printed on the screen.

Good work and Best Regards.
