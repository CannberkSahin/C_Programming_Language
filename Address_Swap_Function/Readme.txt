C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

In this program, a program has been written that swap the addresses of two variables 
to show the use of pointer to pointer. In the program, the addresses of two int types 
of variables are kept in pointer variables named * p1 and * p2. The addresses of these 
variables are sent as arguments to a function named pswap. The function named pswap 
takes the address of two pointer variables as arguments. Those who exchange these 
addresses are doing the transactions. Variables with changing addresses are also 
swapped with each other.


Good work and Best Regards.
