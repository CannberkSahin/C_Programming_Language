C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

In C language, a series of for loops can be traversed with the pointer method.
Pointer arithmetic comes into play here. First, an array named a was created.
Then the address of the first element of this array is given to array decay and pointer variable named ptr.
The last array was traversed by typing a [i] and ptr [i].
The same things are written on the screen.

Good work and Best Regards.
