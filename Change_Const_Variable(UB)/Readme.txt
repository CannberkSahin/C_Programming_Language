C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

In C language, if an object is used together with the const keyword, 
the value of that object can no longer be changed.
The const keyword used in the C language is an oxymoron.
Because in the C language, objects are named variables.
However, the word const promises that the variables do not change.
Oxymoron means that there is a contradiction within its definition.
An attempt to change variables used with the const keyword in the C language is undefined behavior.
In this program, the value of a const object has been changed with a little trick.
However, this should not be done because it is undefined behavior.

Good work and Best Regards.
