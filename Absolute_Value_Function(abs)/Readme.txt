C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

Good work and Best Regards.
