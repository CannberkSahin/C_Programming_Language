C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

In this program, codes were written to get the index of the months from the text.
A const char * type array consisting of months was created. In this array,there 
are 12 months in a year. The program prompts the user to enter the name of a month. 
In this way, the program calculates how many indexed months of the year.
A char type array was created to get the name of the month from the user.
In order to calculate the index of the name received from the user, array elements 
were traversed in the for loop. The first for loop is built in the normal way. 
Then this loop is commented out. The reason for this is to be able to use the following 
for loop written as an idiom. With the for loop, a comparison is made with the name entered 
by the user and the char * array with the name of the months. If the user enters the name 
If the value of i is less than 12, the name of the month found is the index of the value of 
the variable i.in the array, the value of the i variable is less than 12. Thus, the month 
of the year is found out. However, if the value of i is equal to or greater than 12, the 
user entered an incorrect name.

Good work and Best Regards.
