C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

Pattern programs in C language, showing how to create various patterns of stars. 
The programs require nested loops (a loop inside another loop). A design of numerals, 
stars, or characters is a way of arranging these in some logical manner, or they 
may form a sequence. Some of these are triangles that have particular importance in 
mathematics. Some patterns are symmetrical, while others are not.
In this program, the Diamond Pattern shape from the asterisk characters was drawn 
on the screen using loops.

Good work and Best Regards.
