C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

In C language, if the const keyword is used both before the 
pointer variable and before the asterisk declarator (*), 
it is called a const pointer const type of variable.
This means that you cannot change both the value and the address of the defined variable.
In this case, if the const keyword is used, 
attempting to change the address and value of the pointer variable will result in a syntax error.

Good work and Best Regards.
