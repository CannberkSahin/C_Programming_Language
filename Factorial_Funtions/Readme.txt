C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

There are more than one algorithm for calculating factorials in C language.
Here, factorial calculations are made in 3 ways. These are the for loop, the while loop, and the recursive methods.
And also look up table used this program. It is important to increase the efficiency.
The compiler used here is GCC.So the int type is 4 bytes.
A data type of 4 bytes can hold a maximum of (4294967296) slightly more than 4 billion numbers.
If you are using int type, then if you calculate factorial after 13, there will be a overflow.
This means undefined behavior (ub).
Therefore, it is necessary to be careful.
In fact, the best factorial calculation method in the C language is to use a look up table(LUT).
Thus, you are protected from both undefined behavior and it becomes a faster program since the processor does not compute.

Good work and Best Regards.
