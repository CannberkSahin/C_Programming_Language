C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

C language is a language based on functional decomposition.
Therefore, big problems are solved by dividing them into small functions.
Too many functions are needed to solve some problems.
Usually makes use of standard C libraries.But in some cases these standard C libraries fall short.
In this case, we need to create our own library in C language. 
The C language library usually contains two files.
One of them is the header file with .h extension and the other is the implementation file with .c extension.
We have written our own library of frequently used functions to avoid rewriting some functions over and over.
The name of the library is mutility. This name was chosen because there is a standard utility 
library in the C language.In order not to conflict with the C language utility library, the letter m, 
meaning our own library, has been added to the beginning of the utility name.
There are many functions in the library, from functions that create arrays of random numbers to small wrappers.

In this program, an example is given for the comparison of the addresses of pointer variables used in the C language.
A string is defined in the sample program. The elements of this array are made up of random integer numbers.
The array has 20 elements and these elements are printed on the screen. Two pointer variables are defined in the program. 
These hold the addresses of two random elements of the array.In the program, the numbers from a randomly determined 
element of the desired array to another randomly determined element should be written in order. 

Good work and Best Regards.
