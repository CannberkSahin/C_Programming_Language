C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

We cannot sent arrays as parameter values to a function in the C language. 
Likewise, return statements (return statements) of functions cannot be an array.
A pointer is used to operate on arrays with functions.
In the C language, the address of the first element of the array is sent to the function, 
and the desired operations are performed with pointer arithmetic on the array, 
and the address of the first element of this array is sent to the client code.
In this program, it is desired to create a array of random numbers for testing purposes.
Numbers should be in the range of 0 - 1000. 
For this, firstly, the function rand, which is a standard function in C, is used.
However, since the rand function is set with the same seed value, the same array 
elements are created every time the program is run.
Therefore, the seed value is linked to the time function and srand, 
which is a standard function of C, is used.
However, it is not always wanted to call the srand function. For this, 
a wrapper function named randomize was written for the srand function.
Then, a function named set_random_array using pointer arithmetic was written to operate on arrays.
The function requests the address value of the first element of the array as a parameter.
This process is done with the method called array decay. Therefore, the direct name of the 
array is sent to the first parameter of the function in the test codes.
In the set random array function, a number between 0 and 1000 is generated by taking 
the mod 1000 of the rand function.Later, a function named display_array was written 
to print these numbers on the screen.Pointer arithmetic is also used in this function.
Then, a function named sum array is made to collect the elements of the array a,
which is made up of random numbers. 
This function uses the expression *p++, which is an idiom of pointer arithmetic.
The total numbers are printed on the screen.
After the sum of the elements of the array is found, the average of the array is requested.
Therefore, a function named ge mean array was written. 
Since the average of the numbers will be of float type, the function parameter is selected from double type.
The average of the numbers has been printed on the screen.
Finally, it is requested to calculate the standard deviation of the array elements with averages in the program.
Therefore, the function named standard deviation is written. The result is shown on the screen.

Good work and Best Regards.
