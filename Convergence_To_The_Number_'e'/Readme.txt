C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

The Real Number e.
The number e is an important mathematical constant, approximately equal to 2.71828. 
When used as the base for a logarithm, we call that logarithm the natural logarithm and write it as lnx.

There are a number of different definitions of the number e.
Most of them involve calculus. One is that e is the limit of the sequence whose general term is (1+1/n)^n.
Another is that e is the unique number so that the area under the curve y=1/x from x=1 to x=e is 1 square unit.

Another definition of e involves the infinite series 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + 1/4! + ...  
It can be shown that the sum of this series is e.
The last narrative approach was used in this program. 
The number e was calculated in C language using the factorial series.

Good work and Best Regards.
