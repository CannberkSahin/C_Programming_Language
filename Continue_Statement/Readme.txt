C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

In the C language, continue is a frequently used control statement in some cases.
This program shows how to use the continue control statement. The code written is not used in industry.
The aim is to explain the logic of the continue statement.
An object named i is defined with a value of 0 in the program.
Next, a while loop between 0 and 20 was performed.
If the value of i is 3 and its multiples, the program enters the if control block and prints the number with --> sign.
Then the program returns to the beginning because it comes to the continue statement.
That's why *-. signs do not appear on the screen.
If the numbers are not a multiple of 3, the program does not come to the if statement. 
Therefore, only the number on the screen and the next to them * - . signs are written on the screen.
What is meant here is that if the program comes to the continue statement, 
the continue statements under the statement are not made and the program returns to the beginning.

Good work and Best Regards.
