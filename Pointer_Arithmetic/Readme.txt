C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

Pointers are a very important topic in the C language.
Pointers are generally used by performing arithmetic operations. 
Especially in array operations, pointer arithmetic is used.
To show this, an array named a, consisting of 10 elements, is defined.
The address of the first element of the 
array is given as the initial value to the pointer variable named ptr.
Then the array is traversed in the for loop.
In C language a [n] and *(a + n) are the same.The compiler ensures this.
So n [a] and *(n + a) are the same.
In the loop, the variable i starts with the value 0 and continues up to 10.
The value of a [i] becomes a [0], which is converted to *(a + 0) with 
pointer arithmetic to access the first element of the array. 
Then the loop deams a [1] ie *(a + 1). 
Here a is the address of the first element of the array.

Good work and Best Regards.
