C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

Mathematical calculations are used frequently in the C language.
In particular, the areas and circles of geometric shapes are calculated.
Two functions that calculate the area of the circle are written in this program.
One of the functions uses the return method and the other uses the pointer method.

Good work and Best Regards.
