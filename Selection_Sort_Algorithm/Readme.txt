C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

C language is a language based on functional decomposition.
Therefore, big problems are solved by dividing them into small functions.
Too many functions are needed to solve some problems.
Usually makes use of standard C libraries.But in some cases these standard C libraries fall short.
In this case, we need to create our own library in C language. 
The C language library usually contains two files.
One of them is the header file with .h extension and the other is the implementation file with .c extension.
We have written our own library of frequently used functions to avoid rewriting some functions over and over.
The name of the library is mutility. This name was chosen because there is a standard utility 
library in the C language.In order not to conflict with the C language utility library, the letter m, 
meaning our own library, has been added to the beginning of the utility name.
There are many functions in the library, from functions that create arrays of random numbers to small wrappers.

In this program, the frequently used selection sort algorithm in C language is shown. 
A function named Selection Sort has been written. The complexity of the algorithm is O(n)^2.
Selection Sort : The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element 
(considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains 
two subarrays in a given array.

1) The subarray which is already sorted.
2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

n every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted 
subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.

Following example explains the above steps:

arr[] = 64 25 12 22 11

// Find the minimum element in arr[0...4]
// and place it at beginning
11 25 12 22 64

// Find the minimum element in arr[1...4]
// and place it at beginning of arr[1...4]
11 12 25 22 64

// Find the minimum element in arr[2...4]
// and place it at beginning of arr[2...4]
11 12 22 25 64

// Find the minimum element in arr[3...4]
// and place it at beginning of arr[3...4]
11 12 22 25 64 

In this program,An Array of 100 random numbers has been created. Thanks to the written selection sort function, 
the array is ordered from small to large.

Good work and Best Regards.
