C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

C language is a language based on functional decomposition.
Therefore, big problems are solved by dividing them into small functions.
Too many functions are needed to solve some problems.
Usually makes use of standard C libraries.But in some cases these standard C libraries fall short.
In this case, we need to create our own library in C language. 
The C language library usually contains two files.
One of them is the header file with .h extension and the other is the implementation file with .c extension.
We have written our own library of frequently used functions to avoid rewriting some functions over and over.
The name of the library is mutility. This name was chosen because there is a standard utility 
library in the C language.In order not to conflict with the C language utility library, the letter m, 
meaning our own library, has been added to the beginning of the utility name.
There are many functions in the library, from functions that create arrays of random numbers to small wrappers.

The return value of an array in the C language can be a pointer, ie an address.
A function that finds the largest element of the array is written in this program.
The name of the function is get_max_array.The return value type of the function is int*.
The function has two parameter variables. These are const int * p, size_t size. 
The variable const int * p requires the address of the first element of the array. 
The const keyword at the beginning means that it does not set the elements of this array.
The size_t variable requires the number of elements in the array. The type of the value 
generated by the size_t sizeof operator. It is used to make source code portable in the C language.
const int * pmax = p; With the statement, the address value of p * is given as the initial value 
to the pointer variable named pmax. Then, by writing a for loop, the algorithm to find the largest
element of the array was implemented. Finally return (int *) pmax; The statement indicates that 
the return value of the function is the address of pmax. Note the (int *) expression. 
This is called const cast. This is written because the type of the pmax address is const int *. 
However, the return value type of the Function is int *. This is not a syntax error in the C language, 
and an implicit conversion is made. However, it is a wrong behavior to make this transformation implicit.
However, if there is no error in the code written, const cast is made to show that we have done this 
consciously and willingly. In the program, integers from the smallest to the largest element of the 
array are required to be displayed on the screen. In order to do this, first the index of the smallest 
element of the array is found, then the index of the largest element is found, the numbers in between 
are printed on the screen according to pointer arithmetic.

Good work and Best Regards.
