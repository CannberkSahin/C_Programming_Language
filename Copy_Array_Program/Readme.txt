C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

The program asks us to create an array of 100 elements from random numbers.
Then it says to copy from array a to an empty array b.
However, copying has a condition.
Copying will be made starting from a certain index of the a array
then a certain number of copies to a particular index of the b array.
The requested numbers will be taken from the user.
In this program, the above problem has been solved.
First, a sequence of random numbers was created.
Next, an empty b-sequence was created.
With formatted input and output operations, 
the user has been asked for the index of the array a and the array b, 
as well as the number values to which many elements will be copied.
Then, the elements of the array a and the values of the elements 
copied into the b array are printed on the screen.

Good work and Best Regards.
