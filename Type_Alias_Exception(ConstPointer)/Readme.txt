C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

Type alias are important in the C language.
In this program, low level const and top level const types are given type alias.
typedef int * IPTR; after writing const IPTR ptr = & x; When the statement is written, 
the expectation is that this situation is low level const. However, in C language 
this is an exception. So the statement is an example of top level const.
If you want to give the low level const a alias typedef const int * CIPTR; statement should be used.

Good work and Best Regards.
