C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

In C language, if the const keyword asterisk (*) is to the right of the declarator 
and to the left of the variable, it is called a const pointer. 
In this case, the variable named p is the const pointer.
In other words, the address value, which is the value of the p variable, does not change.
However, the value of the p variable may change. Since the value of variable 
p can be accessed with the * operator, the value of the expression * p may change.
However, if we change the value of p variable, ie the address, there will be a syntax error.

Good work and Best Regards.
