PROGRAMMING and C

What is Software?

Software is a collection of instructions and data that tell the computer how to work. This is in contrast to physical hardware, from which the system is built and actually performs the work. In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, including programs and data. Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.At the lowest programming level,executable code consists of machine language instructions supported by an individual processor typically a central processing unit (CPU) or a graphics processing unit (GPU). A machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computerâ€”an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction may also invoke one of many input or output operations, for example displaying some text on a computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the user. The processor executes the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to "jump" to a different instruction, or is interrupted by the operating system. As of 2015, most personal computers, smartphone devices and servers have processors with multiple execution units or multiple processors performing computation together, and computing has become a much more concurrent activity than in the past.

The majority of software is written in high-level programming languages. They are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to natural languages than machine languages. High-level languages are translated into machine language using a compiler or an interpreter or a combination of the two. Software may also be written in a low-level assembly language, which has strong correspondence to the computer's machine language instructions and is translated into machine language using an assembler.

What is Hardware?

Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the case, central processing unit (CPU), monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, speakers and motherboard.

By contrast, software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware is so-termed because it is "hard" or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is "soft" because it is easy to change.

Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system, although other systems exist with only hardware.

Software Classification
The software can be divided into various groups according to their application areas:

1. Scientific software and engineering software
It is the software used in solving problems in scientific subjects and engineering applications. The amount of data in this type of software is relatively low, but
mathematical and statistical algorithms are used extensively.Such programs mainly involve computational processes and make heavy use of the computer's central processing unit (CPU).Programs that solve electronic circuits, statistical analysis packages, can be given as examples of such programs.

2. Application software
It is software related to database. It is generally about the creation, processing and storage of data in files.Stock control programs, customer monitoring programs, accounting programs can be given as examples of such programs.

3. Artificial intelligence software
They are software that imitate the intellectual or learning-oriented behaviors of people.For example, robot software, programs that play chess or bridge, etc. can be given.

4. Visual software
They are programs in which visual processes and algorithms are used extensively.As an example, game and animation software can be given. These softwares mainly use the computer's graphical interface.

5. Simulation software
They are software used to simulate a system in a computer environment. For example Matlab, Proteus etc.

6. System software
It is the software that manages the electronic structure of the computer. Compilers, communication programs, operating systems are system software.For example, a text processing program is also a system software. They perform lower level processing than application programs.

Evaluation Criteria of Programming Languages
The sources mention the existence of approximately 1000 - 1500 programming languages currently in use.
Why are there so many programming languages?
Why are new programming languages still being designed although there are so many programming languages?
What are the features that make one programming language different from another or others?
What qualifiers can be used if it is necessary to define a programming language?
In order to answer these questions, there should be criteria that allow for evaluation. These criteria are briefly analyzed below:

Programming Language Level
The level of a programming language is the measure of the proximity of that programming language to human perception or a machine. The closer a programming language is to human perception, the higher(higer level) it means. Again, the closer a programming language is to the electronic structure and operating style of the computer, the lower level it means.There is an "instruction set" recognized by the computer's processor. The processor can only run commands within its instruction set. The text written in the programming language is converted into commands in the instruction set of the computer's processor at the end of some processes.Working with high-level languages is easy for the programmer, it does not require a good knowledge of algorithms. Only what to do in these languages is notified to the program, but how will not be notified. In general, the higher the level of the programming language, the easier it is to learn the language and write programs in the language. Machine language is the natural language of the computer, it depends on the hardware design of the computer. With the development of computers, machine languages were the first languages used to make them work. That is why machine languages are also called first generation languages.There are two main problems encountered in using machine language in programs. Codes written in machine language are commands given directly to the machine's processor and hardware parts.
