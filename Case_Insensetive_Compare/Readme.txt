C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

The C language is case sensitive.
Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the capital and small letters used in the letters.
If you want to use both lowercase and uppercase letters as the same character, you can use this program.
No spaces should be left between characters while entering the program.
Because the program uses getchar, which is an unformatted input function.
While the formatted input function scanf ignores the space character, the getchar function treats the space as a character.
For this reason, when logging in, you should do it as aA for example.
If an entry like a b is made, an error will occur.

Good work and Best Regards.
