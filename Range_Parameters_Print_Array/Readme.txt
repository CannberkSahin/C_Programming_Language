C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

In C language, the elements of the array can be traversed with the help of pointers.
In the C language, the size of the array is usually required when creating a function 
that prints the elements of an array. However, if we use pointer variables, there is 
no need to ask for the size of the array. For this, the address of the first element 
of the array and the address of the last element will be sufficient. Thus, by incrementing 
the address of the first element by one loop, we can access all the elements of the array 
and print all elements on the screen.In this program, a function named Range_Parameters_Print_Array 
has been written to demonstrate the above.

Good work and Best Regards.
