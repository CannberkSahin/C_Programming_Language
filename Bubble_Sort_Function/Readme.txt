C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

C language is a language based on functional decomposition.
Therefore, big problems are solved by dividing them into small functions.
Too many functions are needed to solve some problems.
Usually makes use of standard C libraries.But in some cases these standard C libraries fall short.
In this case, we need to create our own library in C language. 
The C language library usually contains two files.
One of them is the header file with .h extension and the other is the implementation file with .c extension.
We have written our own library of frequently used functions to avoid rewriting some functions over and over.
The name of the library is mutility. This name was chosen because there is a standard utility 
library in the C language.In order not to conflict with the C language utility library, the letter m, 
meaning our own library, has been added to the beginning of the utility name.
There are many functions in the library, from functions that create arrays of random numbers to small wrappers.

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements 
if they are in wrong order.
Example:
First Pass:
( 5 1 4 2 8 ) –> ( 1 5 4 2 8 ), Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 5 > 1.
( 1 5 4 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 5 2 8 ), Swap since 5 > 4
( 1 4 5 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Swap since 5 > 2
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Now, since these elements are already in order (8 > 5), algorithm does not swap them.

Second Pass:
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 )
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ), Swap since 4 > 2
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –>  ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
Now, the array is already sorted, but our algorithm does not know if it is completed. The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted.

Third Pass:
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )

In this program, a function has been written to use the bubble sort algorithm.
Using pointer variables, the elements of the array are ordered in ascending order.

Good work and Best Regards.
