C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

If the const keyword is used to the left of both the asterisk (*) declarator 
and the variable name in C language, it is called a low level const pointer.
If a variable of type int is used, this case is also called Pointer To Const int.
This implies that the * p expression should not change. 
So the value of x cannot be changed anymore.
However, in this case, the p value, ie the address value, may change.
If you want to change the * p expression, then a syntax error will occur.

Good work and Best Regards.
