C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself.
For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371.
The program is written using nested for loops.
Write a program to find all Armstrong number in the range of 100 and 999.
The aim is to print the 3-digit Armstrong numbers on the screen.
Therefore, a variable is initialized by giving the first value of 100.

Good work and Best Regards.
