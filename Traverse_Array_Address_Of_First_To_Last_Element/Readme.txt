C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

In C language, the elements of the array can be traversed with the help of pointers.
One of the ways to do this is to specify the address of the first element of the array, 
then the address of the last element of the array. Then, with a loop, it is to continue 
the loop as long as the address of the last element of the array is not equal to the 
address of the first element. In this program, it is shown how the algorithm described
above is implemented. First, a 10-element array named a is created. Later, the address of 
the first element of this array is assigned to the variable *p1 and the address of 
the last element to the variable named *p2. Then, in a while loop, the elements of the array 
*p1++; In the next round, the other elements of the array are printed on the screen, 
thanks to the ++ operator.

Good work and Best Regards.
