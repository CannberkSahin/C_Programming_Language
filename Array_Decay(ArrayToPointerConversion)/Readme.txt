C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

The name of an array in the C language is always converted to the address of the 
first element of the array when used in an expression.This event happens both with initialization and assignment.
This program shows that the name of the array is converted to the address of the first element of the array.


Good work and Best Regards.
