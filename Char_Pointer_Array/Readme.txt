C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

In this program, an array is defined with char * type elements and its name is pmons.
The size of the array is not specified, because the elements of the array are initialized.
String literals are used in the array. pmons is an array with 12 elements.
The type of each element of the Pmons array is char *. Each element is given initial value 
with string literals. The first element of the Pointer array shows the January text. 
The second element shows the February inscription. This process is the same for 12 elements.
We can access char arrays with string literals using the elements of this pointer array.
Data structures created in this way are called look-up tables.The pointer array is traversed 
with the for loop. Since the elements of the pointer array are addresses, the puts function 
can be used.


Good work and Best Regards.
