C codes are written in the CodeBlocks development environment.
The object code file was created by compiling the C code. 
It has also been tested whether it works or not. It works without any problems.
Two standard C libraries are used.These are stdio.h and stdlib.h
If you want to run the program, you can find the .exe extension in the bin folder.

In software development, obfuscation is the deliberate act of creating 
source or machine code that is difficult for humans to understand. 
Like obfuscation in natural language, it may use needlessly roundabout 
expressions to compose statements. Programmers may deliberately obfuscate 
code to conceal its purpose (security through obscurity) or its logic or 
implicit values embedded in it, primarily, in order to prevent tampering, 
deter reverse engineering, or even to create a puzzle or recreational 
challenge for someone reading the source code. This can be done manually 
or by using an automated tool, the latter being the preferred technique in industry.
In this program, a small obfuscation example is shown using the 
adressoff operator(&), which is the pointer operator.

Good work and Best Regards.
